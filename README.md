# Time Deposit Refactoring Kata
## XA bank time deposit

It's unfortunate that the junior developer has left the company without handing his work over to anyone. And what is even more unfortunate is that you have been assigned to take over the code that he left behind. 

We were only able to salvage a portion of the business requirements. It is possible that there are some features that the user has requested and are already implemented in the code but not documented.

- The system should calculate the monthly interest based on the account type.
- No interest will be added to any time deposit plans for the first 30 days. 
- There are 3 types of time deposit plans available within the bank: basic, student, and premium
  - basic plan: 1%
  - student plan: 3%
  - premium plan: 5%
- Aside from the premium plan, which follows an auto-renewal strategy, all existing time deposit plans should be terminated after 1 year. After the plan is terminated, the balance of the time deposit account should become 0 as the funds will automatically be transferred to their savings account. 

We would like you to refactor the solution and ensure that the implementation meets all of the above requirements. Since the code is already running in production and no bugs have been reported regarding this feature, you can assume that all existing functionalities are implemented correctly. Please ensure that no existing functionalities are broken.

Limitations: 
- You may not add any additional methods to the TimeDeposit class
- You may not modify the calculateInterest method signature

The TimeDeposit class contains all the necessary information to evaluate the applicable interest rate. If additional criteria are to be considered, we expect them to be added to the TimeDeposit class.

PS: For the sake of time, you should assume that all inputs are valid. Please treat this as an actual assignment on the project and apply all the best practices that you know of.
